This repository consolidates all the components of my end-to-end Business Intelligence portfolio, built to demonstrate the implementation of a possible **Extract-Load-Transform and Analyse** Architecture in an organizational context. The key components of this architecture are: data integration, transformation & modeling, and storytelling. It also highlights the possibility of automating the entire process.

The BI ELT Architecture to be implemented is shown on the following image!.
